This is a fun little program that can help you solve those Sudoku boards that you just can't seem to wrap your head around!
It allows you to play 4 pre-made boards of varying difficulty from : Easy, Medium, Hard, or Expert. It also allows you to input
your own boards that you want solved.

The program works by taking advantage of the power of recursive backtracking in order to find the solution. This allows it to find 
the solution much faster than the "naive" solution or burte force method.

I also wanted to learn how to create and manipulate 2d arrays in python which is what the "create_empty_board" and "fill_board" 
functions are doing.
